# Epidemic_Study_Covid19
Modelisation and Dynamic of an Epidemic (Covid-19) case study from Morocco


this project examines the role of population confinement and isolation of infected individuals in managing the spread of epidemics, with a particular focus on **Covid-19 in Morocco**. The study analyzes the impact of the basic reproduction number, a key factor in epidemic transmission. To address this issue, we compared the two periods, before and after confinement: the pre-confinement period marked by the emergence of local cases, and the post-confinement period (starting from March 20), characterized by the wider spread of the epidemic within the population.
